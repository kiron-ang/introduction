Hi there!

This repository contains a tutorial for people that want to learn more about analyzing single-cell transcriptomic data with Python! The tutorial features some publicly available data from this open access research paper:

> Notaro, M., Borghetti, M., Bresesti, C. et al. In vivo armed macrophages curb liver metastasis through tumor-reactive T-cell rejuvenation. Nat Commun 16, 3471 (2025). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-58369-2

Make sure to read the paper before starting the tutorial! You can view the "introduction.ipynb" file directly on GitHub, or at kiron-ang.github.io/introduction. The "license.txt" file explains that this repository's code is free for anyone to use. So, mentors can modify my tutorial to suit their needs. 

Finally, the "index.html" file contains code for the website at kiron-ang.github.io/introduction. Please contact Kiron Ang at kiron_ang1@baylor.edu if you have any comments or questions. I hope this tutorial is helpful!

Sincerely,

Kiron Ang
